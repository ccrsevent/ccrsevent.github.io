Hung-Jeng Tsai is the Director of the Center of Carbon Research and Solutions (CCRS) at the National Sun Yat-Sen University (NSYSU). He is also the Professor and Director of the Graduate Institute of Marine Affairs. CCRS works closely with TCX to establish a local voluntary carbon market and drive the carbon reduction technology chain. To that purpose, CCRS systematically researches net zero-related regulations, including mandatory and voluntary carbon pricing systems, carbon credit rating systems, ESG, and green financing. We also provide carbon management consultation and conduct learning courses to promote local sustainability education.
